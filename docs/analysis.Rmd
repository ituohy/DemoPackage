***Introduction***

  I chose this sample because I was curious about the intricacies of how banks approve different loans for different types of people. Above all, I had hoped to learn what the most important aspects of someone's banking information relates to 




```{r}
lda.fit <- lda(Personal.Loan~Income, data=bank.train)

projected <- as.matrix(bank.train$Income) %*% as.matrix(lda.fit$scaling)
ldahist(projected, bank.train$Personal.Loan, xlab="")
```


```{r}
bank %>%
  select(-c(CreditCard,CD.Account,Education,Family,Online,Securities.Account,ZIP.Code))%>%
  gather(-Personal.Loan, key = "some_var_name", value = "Numeric_Variables") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Numeric_Variables, y = Personal.Loan)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~ some_var_name, scales = "free")
```
